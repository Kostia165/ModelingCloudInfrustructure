# ModelingCloudInfrustructure
This project is using framework CloudSim Plus for modeling cloud infrustructure and testing different algorithms on it.

The main files are files which names are starting from 'MyAlgorithm'. All 3 files are implementing 3 different task placement algorithms. 48 tasks are executing in model by default, all task parameters can be changed to test another behavior.
